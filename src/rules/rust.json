{
  "BorrowCheckerError": {
    "what": "Attempted to use a value after it was moved or borrowed",
    "why": "Rust's ownership system prevents multiple mutable references or using moved values",
    "fix": [
      "Clone the value if you need to use it multiple times",
      "Use references (&) instead of moving values",
      "Restructure code to avoid conflicting borrows",
      "Consider using Rc<RefCell<T>> for shared mutable ownership"
    ]
  },
  "LifetimeError": {
    "what": "Value does not live long enough for its reference",
    "why": "Reference outlives the value it points to, causing potential use-after-free",
    "fix": [
      "Extend the lifetime of the referenced value",
      "Use owned values instead of references",
      "Add explicit lifetime parameters to functions",
      "Restructure code to ensure values live long enough"

  "TypeMismatch": {
    "what": "Type does not match expected type",
    "why": "Rust is strictly typed and requires exact type matches",
    "fix": [
      "Check the expected type in the error message",
      "Use type conversion (as, into, try_into)",
      "Update function signature to accept the correct type",
      "Verify generic type parameters are correct"

  "Panic": {
    "what": "Program panicked at runtime",
    "why": "Unrecoverable error occurred, often from unwrap(), expect(), or array bounds",
    "fix": [
      "Replace unwrap() with proper error handling (Result, Option)",
      "Add bounds checking before array access",
      "Use match or if let for Option/Result values",
      "Add validation before operations that can panic"
    ]

  "CargoError": {
    "what": "Cargo build or dependency error",
    "why": "Build system failed, often due to missing dependencies or compilation errors",
    "fix": [
      "Run 'cargo clean' and rebuild",
      "Check Cargo.toml for correct dependencies",
      "Update Rust toolchain: rustup update",
      "Verify all dependencies are compatible"
